# Mobile Store

Mobile store is a mobile app to show products and allow you to add products in the cart.


## Requirements

2. Products will be obtained through an API;
3. In the cart, allow to increase, decrease and remove products;
4. Testing routine with jest and cypress.


## About the project

To save the products added to the cart I used sqlite.
And so that prices appear updated every time the cart is opened, I make a new request to update the prices, name, stock and image.
